            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>
              At age 22, I made one of the biggest decisions of my life. I left
              my old career behind to follow my passion for programming. I
              didn’t have a degree in the field, but that didn’t matter to me. I
              was driven by my love for coding and creating things from scratch.
              It wasn’t easy at first, but I knew that with hard work, I could
              make it happen.<br />
              I started with the basics: HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. These were
              the building blocks of everything I would go on to create. Once I
              had a solid foundation, I moved on to JavaScript a language that
              challenged me but also sparked my creativity. It was tough,
              especially since I had no prior experience with programming.
              That’s when I decided to take a class at Fairway Technology, and
              it was the right move. I began learning Java as a foundation to
              build my programming knowledge.<br />
              There was a moment during that class when everything clicked, and
              I truly enjoyed the whole concept of programming. I was so glad I
              chose this path. After completing the basics, I felt ready to dive
              deeper into JavaScript. I spent countless hours sometimes up to
              ten a day learning everything I could, focusing on one concept at
              a time and applying them to my projects.<br />
              Then I took the professional web developer class at Fairway
              Technology, and it was a game-changer for me. I learned so much
              about both frontend and backend development, and it’s been
              invaluable to my growth. As I’ve grown, I’ve learned that coding
              isn’t just about understanding the technical aspects; it’s about
              finding joy in the problem-solving process.<br />
              Looking ahead, I’m excited to keep expanding my skills, especially
              in backend development. My learning journey is far from over. I’m
              determined to keep pushing forward and achieve everything I want
              in this field. This journey has shown me that when I put in the
              work, I can achieve anything and I can’t wait to see where it
              takes me next.
            </p>
            <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
            <p>
              It's pretty clear that coding has become my main passion. It’s
              taken over most of my previous interests, and honestly, I’m okay
              with that. I used to spend a lot more time playing games and
              watching movies, but now I’d rather dive into a coding project or
              challenge myself with a tricky projects like this. Don’t get me
              wrong, I still enjoy playing games and watching movies , but
              they’ve taken a back seat to my current obsession.<br />
              And then there’s music. Music has been my constant companion,
              especially since I usually code on my own. I’ve always loved it,
              but it’s become even more important lately. I’m really into blues,
              jazz, and alternative rock, it’s what keeps me going during long
              coding sessions. There’s something about the flow of jazz or the
              vibe of blues that just clicks with my mind when I’m deep into
              problem-solving. It almost feels like the music is a part of the
              process, helping me stay focused and in the zone.<br />
              I’m definitely an introvert and pretty comfortable with that. I
              have a few close friends, but I don’t spend a lot of time with
              them. I prefer staying on my own and focusing on what I enjoy.
              It’s not that I’m bad at communicating, I just don’t like it as
              much. I’d rather observe things from the sidelines. Still, I do
              enjoy making new friends when the opportunity comes up. I love
              genuine connections and getting to know people, even if I mostly
              keep to myself. I am super talkactive person when I am with close
              friends.
            </p>
            <h2>Life Goals</h2>
            <p>
              My vision for life is pretty simple. I want to own a bread
              shop someday, not a huge company, but a small place where I can
              create and share something special. I love the idea of building
              something with my own hands and connecting with people in a
              meaningful way.<br />

              Before I reach that point, my main priority is to become a person
              my family can rely on and be proud of. I want to support them in
              every way I can. That’s why I’m working towards a career in
              programming, something I’m truly passionate about and excited to
              keep growing in. For now, I’m focused on becoming a professional
              in web development and building a solid foundation. But I have
              bigger plans. I want to dive deeper into programming, explore new
              technologies, and challenge myself to master different areas. I
              believe that with dedication, I can get where I want to be.<br />

              At the same time, I understand that life isn’t just about
              achievements. My priority is to live fully, take care of myself,
              and stay healthy. I want to avoid burning out or getting lost in
              the rush to achieve my goals. Ultimately, I believe I’ll reach my
              dreams, but I’m also taking the time to appreciate the journey.
